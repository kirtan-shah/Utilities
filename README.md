# Utilities

You can use code in this repository to help you with everyday programming.
All code in this repository will be commented so that you can understand how everything works.
This project is aimed to provide programmers with helpful utilities they can use to make coding faster.
It is highly recommended you review the source code before you use it so you can not only code faster,
but also understand fundamental concepts in programming.

# Tips:
1. Compiled libraries are available in the "lib" folder
2. Source code is in the "src" folder
3. If you need to alter any code slightly, please copy paste from the src folder and modify it.
   There is also a build tool you can use if you want to quickly rebuild code from scratch. Just click and run.
